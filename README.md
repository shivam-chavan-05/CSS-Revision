## About This Project
This Repository was created as a hands-on practice project to strengthen my CSS skills. It follows along with Dave Gray's 12-hour CSS course, covering foundational to advanced styling concepts. 
The repository contains all the files developed throughout the course, including exercises and layout designs. It's intended as both a reference and a showcase of the techniques learned during the tutorial.
